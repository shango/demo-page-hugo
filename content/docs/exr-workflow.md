# Multi-channel EXR File Workflow in Adobe After Effects 2025


## Introduction 

OpenEXR (EXR) is a professional image format that supports high-dynamic-range color and multi-pass rendering, allowing artists to store and access multiple render layers in a single file.

This guide provides a quick-start workflow for integrating multi-channel 32-bit OpenEXR (EXR) files into Adobe After Effects using an Academy Color Encoding System (ACES) pipeline. It explains how to configure After Effects for ACES color management, interpret EXR footage correctly, composite in a 32-bit linear color space, and export while preserving color fidelity.

---

## Who Is This Guide For?

This guide is designed for VFX artists and compositors who need to maintain color accuracy when working with EXR files in After Effects as part of an ACES-compliant workflow.

The workflow is intended for use in professional visual effects pipelines and assumes a working knowledge of After Effects and basic familiarity with EXR files.

## What This Guide Covers

This guide steps you through implementing a color-managed workflow in After Effects using multi-channel EXR files.

By the end of this guide, you’ll be able to:

- Set up your After Effects environment for 32-bit EXR workflows

- Apply ACES color transforms using OCIO to maintain color accuracy

- Access and individual render passes from EXR files for compositing

- Render to EXRs while preserving consistent color fidelity

## What Are 32-bit Multi-channel EXR Files?

32-bit multi-channel EXR files are the industry standard for high-dynamic-range scene-linear image data. They support multiple render passes in a single file, 32-bit floating-point color, and lossless compression.

For more information, see the [OpenEXR documentation](https://openexr.com/en/latest/).

### The After Effects built-in OCIO color engine
{: .no_toc }

After Effects includes a built-in OpenColorIO (OCIO) color engine, which provides a complete color management solution for motion picture workflows.


For an in-depth overview, visit [OpenColorIO](https://opencolorio.org/).

OCIO handles all color transformations, maintaining color consistency from import through compositing to final output.

ACES is a standardized color management framework designed to ensure consistency across digital imaging workflows. It enables accurate color interchange, supports complex compositing pipelines, and facilitates the creation of high-fidelity masters for distribution and archival.

To dive deeper into ACES, visit the [ACES Central website](https://acescentral.com/).

## Setting Up the After Effects Project

Disable Adobe’s native color management and enable OCIO color management (see Figure 1).

1. Navigate to **Edit > Project Settings**.

2. In the Project Settings window, select the **Color** tab.

3. Change the Color Engine to **OCIO color managed**.

4. Set the OCIO Configuration to **ACES 1.2**.

5. Ensure that the Bit Depth is set to **32 bits per channel (float)**.
   
6. Under **Working Color Space**, select:  

   **compositing_linear: ACES - ACEScg** (This sets the compositor to ACES version of linear light for the project)

7. In the **Display Color Space** section, choose either **ACES/sRGB** or **ACES/Rec.709** depending on your monitor's color profile.

## Importing Your Footage

To import your EXR sequence, navigate to **File > Import > File…**.

In the Import dialog (see Figure 2), select the first frame of your EXR sequence. Then, in the **Sequence Options** section, select: **OpenEXR Sequence**

Next, under **Import As**, select: **Composition – Retain Layer Sizes**

Click **Import** to bring the sequence into your After Effects project.

After selecting your files and clicking **Import**, you'll see the **Import Options** dialog (see Figure 3). A recommended workflow is to import the footage as a composition, automatically pre-compose the layers, and generate a contact sheet—a composition that displays all layers from the EXR sequence for easy preview.

In the **Import Options** dialog box select: 

1. Import As: **Composition**
   
3. **Pre-compose Layers**

5. **Create Contact Sheet**

## Footage Interpretation

After importing your footage, apply the correct input transform to each clip (see Figure 4).

Steps to correctly interpret footage:

1. Right-click the footage in the Project panel and choose **Interpret Footage**.

2. In the **Interpret Footage** dialog, check **Show All** next to the *Media Color Space* dropdown.

3. From the dropdown, select the correct media color space based on the footage’s origin (e.g., **Alexa LogC**, **sRGB**, **Rec.709** etc.).

4. Repeat for all source clips.

> For 8- or 16-bit files with unknown color profiles, you may need to experiment. Try **ACES/sRGB** or **ACES/Rec.709** and select whichever gives the most accurate result.*

## Working with EXtractoR

The **EXtractoR** plugin allows control of which layers and channels are displayed (see Figure 6).

Each pre-composed layer will use the After Effects **EXtractoR** plugin to isolate individual channels and layers from the EXR file.

For an in-depth overview, visit this document [Adobe After Effects, Included Third Party Effects](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/3d-channel-effects.html)

**Double click** the Contact Sheet composition in your Project Panel.  In the Project panel, you will see a thumbnail representation of each layer in your EXR Files (see Figure 5).

## Exporting with the Correct Color Space

Configure your output settings to match the desired color space.

In the Output Module settings, go to the **Color** tab and select the appropriate output color space to match your project or delivery format (see Figure 7).

**Steps:**

1. Add your composition to the **Render Queue**.

2. In the **Render Queue** panel, click on the **Output Module** settings.

3. In the **Output Color Space** dropdown, select the appropriate color space.  

   This is typically the same as the original input footage or required delivery format.

4. Click **Render** to begin the export process.

## Final Notes

- Always verify color settings at every stage of the pipeline—input, composition, and export.

- Consider using consistent naming conventions for exported files to indicate color space (e.g., `Scene01_shotA_ACEScg.exr`).

- Ensure that all departments in your pipeline use the same OCIO configuration to maintain color consistency.
