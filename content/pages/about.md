My career began in visual effects, where I worked as a compositor on projects for Netflix, Opsis, and Bix Pix Entertainment. While delivering creative work under tight deadlines, I also became the go-to person for documenting the technical side of production—pipelines, color management, workflows, and system configurations. In recognition of my contributions, I was personally nominated, along with my department colleagues, for a 2023 Emmy Award for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Live Action Program.

What I found most rewarding in these roles was not just the creative output, but the documentation I produced that reduced onboarding time, standardized workflows, and supported cross-functional collaboration. That documentation work set the foundation for my full transition into technical writing. To strengthen my technical base, I’ve pursued computer science studies and hands-on programming experience in Python, Git, and Linux. My portfolio (shango.github.io) reflects this blend of skills, with documentation samples that cover developer processes, APIs, and complex systems.
