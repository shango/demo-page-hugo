## Introduction
Welcome. This site is a collection of my technical writing samples, showcasing different documentation styles and audiences. The goal is to demonstrate how I approach clarity, accuracy, and usability in technical communication. This site is intended to show my documentation process and output for technical projects.

The site itself is built with Hugo (a static site generator), written in Markdown and hosted on GitHub Pages.
