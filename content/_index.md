## Introduction
Welcome. This site is a collection of my technical writing samples, showcasing different documentation styles and audiences. The goal is to demonstrate how I approach clarity, accuracy, and usability in technical communication.

The site itself is built with Hugo, a static site generator, written in markdown and deployed via GitHub Pages.
